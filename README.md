# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for a university Data Mining project aimed at predicting hotel reservation cancellations using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **"Hotel Reservations Classification Dataset"**, which can be found on Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset>

## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can effectively predict whether a hotel reservation is likely to be cancelled or not. This can be valuable for hotels in managing their resources, anticipating cancellations, and potentially mitigating them through targeted marketing or customer service strategies.

## Algorithm

The chosen algorithm for this project is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs are well-suited for classification tasks and have demonstrated effectiveness in various domains.
